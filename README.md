# Optimal portfolio selection
A project devoted to *mean-variance portfolio analysis*, mostly within the *CAPM* framework.  
The optimal portfolio is found among all the combinations of four risky assets (four SP500 stocks), 
by solving a quadratic optimization problem.  
The historical data of the securities are retrieved from *Yahoo finance* through *pandas_datareader*.  

## Exploited libraries
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - cvxopt (convex optimization)
